# Core

This application creates a new process per CPU core. Each of those process are http web servers that listen to localhost:8000. The balancer takes care of calls to port 8000 and redirects them to one of the available workers. Every worker is going to process a request during his lifetime. Then, it suicides. It means you can call localhost:8000 as many times as number of cores you have on your CPU.

## Usage
```
$node core
```
Then, call localhost:8000 from an http client. Calls from browsers also request favicon.ico, so youÂ´ll get two (or more) calls
